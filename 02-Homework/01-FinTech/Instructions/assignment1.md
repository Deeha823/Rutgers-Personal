![Image of Building](high_rise.jpeg)

## Overview and Origin

In a market once dominated by private equity investors and syndicate bank funding, fintech disruptors are dismantling the barriers of entry through direct access funds and crowdsourcing. Cadre, a digital direct real estate firm, has promised to democratize the commercial real estate market. Founded in 2014, CEO Ryan William created Cadre to enable a sophisticated product, accessible for individual investors. Ryan Williams partnered with Thrive Capital founder Josh Kushner and General Catalyst and raised a total of $18 million during the initial funding round. The company has since attracted high-profile investors including, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Goldman Sachs, and others, raising over $68 million. 

At its inception, Cadre’s strategy was to invest in multifamily properties, with the potential to generate cash flow, and then syndicate each deal to investors for a minimum of $50,000. Cadre has since changed its strategy to include a direct access fund, as the deal-by-deal approach did not provide a board, diversified option for institutional investors. The direct access fund limited the potential risk exposure that’s experienced with cash flow problems when tenants are late on payments and eviction suppressions, experienced by the pandemic. According to CBRE Inc.,  “As of Q32021, urban vacancy rates average 5%, just 70 bps above their pre-crisis levels”. (2022). As with any investment strategy, the importance of diversifying assets has assisted Cadre in “defensive value-add investments” (Penta, 2021), to allow for potential double-digit returns.  

## Business Activities

According to the Harvard School of Business Review, the theory of disruptive innovation was first introduced in 1995 and proved to be a powerful focus in the growth of Silicon Valley startups. Disruptive innovation is described when a smaller company, with limited resources, challenges traditional market segments. Disruptive companies leverage technological innovation to supplement resources, thereby decreasing overhead, implementing process efficiencies, designing products, and creating use cases to experienced limited market disruptors. Cadre’s business strategy focuses on outperforming private equity firms, through the use of quantitative methods and machine learning. The company focuses on hiring data scientists and software engineers, to improve predictive models and build an infrastructure, to provide robust models. Cadre’s market model focuses on 40,000 variables and more than 3 million data points, making it one of the most comprehensive CRE models on the market to date. (Cadre, 2022).
Cadre’s approach to CRE investment dismantles traditional barriers associated with private equity firms. The journey to provide accredited investors access to commercial real estate began with the introduction of Cadre’s Direct Access Fund. The direct access fund includes a diversified portfolio of properties, that is backed by data science and is engineered to provide “risk-adjustable” returns. Cadre’s President, Allen Smith shared the fund’s strategy in a recent blog, 

> Cadre has delivered more than 18% net IRR on four complete property sales and as a whole, we’re pleased to have achieved strong portfolio performance and returns through the pandemic, with rent collections averaging 95%+ across Cadre’s portfolio in Q2-Q4 2020[3],” said Smith. The Direct Access Fund will identify what we believe will be rock-solid opportunities that are poised to deliver strong returns while maintaining a very compelling risk profile.” [Introducing The Cadre Direct Access Fund, 2021](https://cadre.com/insights/introducing-the-cadre-direct-access-fund/). 

Paired with data science, Cadre’s underwriting process includes an institutional investment committee process, that co-invests, to ensure transactions have a vested interest. Unlike traditional CRE companies, the underwriting process has human constraints and lacks technological practices that leverage data. Applications and data used by Cadre include the following; JavasScript, Python, HTML, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Node.js. Django, Amazon EC2, and ES6. 

Cadre is committed to building minority communities, through investments into minority depository institutions (MDIs), to assist in maintaining affordable housing. The goal of the company is to create economic equity for underserved minorities, that are usually displaced, due to commercial developments and increased market rates. 

## Landscape

At first glance, Cadre might appear to give the appearance of a crowdsourcing platform. Crowdstreet and Fudrise provide retail investors opportunities to diversity with commercial real estate deals. Crowdsourcing provides a marketplace for connecting institutional sponsors with capital, and provides lower incremental deposits, typically lower than $1k. Crowdsourcing platforms are driven by institutional sponsors that require capital to close. Cadre is driven by data and leverages its capital to ensure the company has a vested interest in the deal, allowing the company to focus on long-term performance. 

Market researchers predict economic growth in the commercial real estate market. CBRE Research 2022 U.S. Real Estate Market Outlook, concluded that the commercial real estate market has fully recovered from the pandemic and will continue to see tremendous growth. According to CRBE, the U.S. market GDP is expected to expand by 4.6% in 2022, with each quarter experiencing a long-term trend of around two percent (2%). The report also sites recent policy changes that name the recently enacted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021), which includes $550 billion in new spending, over the next 10 years. This new legislation will likely translate to increased commercial development and new projects to support small businesses. 

## Results

In 2021, Cadre’s grew exited seven investments with a targeted realized net IRR of 17.8%, and more than $129 mil was distributed to investors. Since 2017, the company distributed more than $287 mil to its investors. Additionally, the company reached $3.5 billion in total transactions across 23 U.S markets. Cadre’s Q42021 Vantage Report expands on the company’s strategy for 2022 to include; an increase in principle deal opportunities, and building out additional investment in Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). 

## Recommendations

Cadre company’s mission is to “give more people the opportunity to improve their financial future”. This slogan can appear misleading, as Cadre’s target demographic is limited to accredited investors. True equitable inclusion requires access for minority retail investors. Although the company aims to achieve economic equality, by making investments in MDIs, it fails to make an economic impact directly on the underserved communities. To forge the bridge to equitable economic inclusion, Cadre should consider the following for underserved minority communities, 
<!--UL -->
* 	Consider lowing minimum investments to extend greater access to minority retail investors;
* 	Target institutional investors with 51% minority investors.

Expanding to retail investors will further expand the company’s initiatives to give more access to individuals, that require access to economic growth and inclusion.
