# CADRE - The Move Toward Democratization of Commercial Real Estate

## Overview and Origin

In a market once dominated by private equity investors and syndicate bank funding, fintech disruptors are dismantling the barriers of entry through direct access funds and crowdsourcing. Cadre, a digital direct real estate firm, has promised to democratize the commercial real estate market. Founded in 2014, CEO Ryan William created Cadre to enable a sophisticated product, accessible for individual investors. Ryan Williams partnered with Thrive Capital founder Josh Kushner and General Catalyst and raised a total of $18 million during the initial funding round. The company has since attracted high-profile investors including, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Goldman Sachs, and others, raising over $68 million. 

At its inception, Cadre’s strategy was to invest in multifamily properties, with the potential to generate cash flow, and then syndicate each deal to investors for a minimum of $50,000. Cadre has since changed its strategy to include a direct access fund, as the deal-by-deal approach did not provide a board, diversified option for institutional investors. The direct access fund limited the potential risk exposure that’s experienced with cash flow problems when tenants are late on payments and eviction suppressions, experienced by the pandemic. According to CBRE Inc.,  “As of Q32021, urban vacancy rates average 5%, just 70 bps above their pre-crisis levels”. (2022). As with any investment strategy, the importance of diversifying assets has assisted Cadre in “defensive value-add investments” (Penta, 2021), to allow for potential double-digit returns.
